This is my first Project with React and Go. It is a simple Ticketsystem.

== General Information for this Ticketsystem

This ticketsystem is a simple system to manage tickets. It is written in React and Go. The Database is a PostgreSQL Database.

== Setup with Docker

=== Prerequisites

* Docker and Docker Compose installed.
* Traefik Proxy as a Docker container.

=== Steps

==== 1. Install Docker and Docker Compose

Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system.
Follow the installation guides:

- Docker: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

- Docker Compose: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

==== 2. Install Traefik Proxy

Start Traefik Proxy as a Docker container with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 8080:8080 --name traefik \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  traefik:v3.0 \
  --api.insecure=true \
  --providers.docker=true \
  --entrypoints.web.address=:80
----

==== 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file and edit `.env` in your project root:

[source,bash]
----
cp .env.example .env
nano .env  # or use your preferred text editor to edit .env
----


==== 4. Project Structure

Ensure your project directory structure is as follows:

[source]
----
project_root/
├─ app/
│  ├─── backend/
│  │   ├─── Dockerfile
│  │   └─── (your Go backend files)
│  └─── frontend/
│      ├─── Dockerfile
│      └─── (your Next.js frontend files)
├─ .env.example
└─ docker-compose.yml
----

==== 5. Start the Project

Navigate to the root directory of your project and run the following command to start the services:

[source,bash]
----
docker-compose up -d
----

This command will build and start all the containers defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file in detached mode.

==== 6. Accessing the Services

- **Frontend**: Access the frontend application via the domain specified in `FRONTEND_DOMAIN` (e.g., http://frontend.yourdomain.com).
- **Backend**: Access the backend application via the domain specified in `BACKEND_DOMAIN` (e.g., http://backend.yourdomain.com).
- **Traefik Dashboard**: Access the Traefik dashboard (if enabled) at http://localhost:8080.

This setup ensures your project is configured with Docker, Docker Compose, Traefik Proxy, and environment variables, allowing for seamless development and deployment of your applications.

== Setup without Docker

=== Prerequisites

* Node.js installed.
* Go installed.
* PostgreSQL installed.

=== Steps

==== 1. Install Node.js

Ensure Node.js is installed on your system.
Follow the installation guide: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

==== 2. Install Go

Ensure Go is installed on your system.
Follow the installation guide: https://golang.org/doc/install

==== 3. Install PostgreSQL

Ensure PostgreSQL is installed on your system.
Follow the installation guide: https://www.postgresql.org/download/

==== 4. Project Structure

Ensure your project directory structure is as follows:

[source]
----
project_root/
├─ app/
│  ├─── backend/    
│  │   └─── (your Go backend files)
│  └─── frontend/
│      └─── (your React frontend files)
├─ .env.example
└─ README.adoc
----

==== 5. Start the Project

Navigate to the root directory of your project and run the following commands to start the services:

- **Frontend**: Navigate to the `frontend` directory and run the following commands:

- Development Mode:
[source,bash]
----
cd app/frontend
yarn install
yarn dev
----

- **Backend**: Navigate to the `backend` directory and run the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
cd app/backend
go run main.go
----

This command will start the backend server.

==== 6. Accessing the Services

- **Frontend**: Access the frontend application via the domain specified in `FRONTEND_DOMAIN` (e.g., http://localhost:3000).

- **Backend**: Access the backend application via the domain specified in `BACKEND_DOMAIN` (e.g., http://localhost:8080).

This setup ensures your project is configured with Node.js, Go, PostgreSQL, and environment variables, allowing for seamless development and deployment of your applications.

==== 7. Database Setup

To set up the database, run the following commands:

- Create the database:
[source,bash]
----
createdb ticketsystem
----

- Run the database migrations:
[source,bash]
----
cd app/backend
go run main.go migrate
----

This will create the necessary tables in the database.

==== 8. Accessing the Database

You can access the database using the following command:

[source,bash]
----
psql ticketsystem
----

This will open the PostgreSQL command-line interface for the `ticketsystem` database.

==== 9. NGINX Configuration / Apache Configuration

If you are using NGINX or Apache, you can configure the web server to serve the frontend and backend applications.

For NGINX, you can create a configuration file in `/etc/nginx/sites-available/` and symlink it to `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/`.

For Apache, you can create a configuration file in `/etc/apache2/sites-available/` and symlink it to `/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/`. 

== Technologies

=== Frontend

==== React

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.

==== Environment Variables

The following environment variables are used in this project:

[%header, cols=3*]
|===
| Name | Description | Default
| APP_ENV | The environment in which the application is running (e.g., DEV, PROD). | PROD
|GIN_MODE | The mode in which the Go application is running (e.g., release, debug). | debug
|=== 

The environment variables follow the following hierarchy:

. -> .env                contains default values for the environment variables needed by the app
. -> .env.local          uncommitted file with local overrides
. -> .env.$APP_ENV       committed environment-specific defaults
. -> .env.$APP_ENV.local uncommitted environment-specific overrides
